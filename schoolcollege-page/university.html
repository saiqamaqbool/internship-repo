        <h3>University</h3>
        <article>
          <p>The Cluster University of Srinagar (CUS) was established in 2016 to decongest the University of Kashmir by pooling the resources of five existing colleges in the city. It is a collegiate state university that offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and integrated programs across various disciplines through its constituent colleges. 
History
Formation: CUS was established under The Srinagar and Jammu Cluster Universities Act, 2016 by the Jammu and Kashmir State Legislature, a move funded by the central government's Rashtriya Uchchattar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) scheme.
Inauguration: The university, along with the Cluster University of Jammu, was formally inaugurated on April 17, 2017.
First Academic Session: CUS began functioning from the 2017â€“2018 academic session.</p>
          <p>Independent state university: CUS is an independent state university, not affiliated with the University of Kashmir. It conducts its own examinations and awards its own degrees.
Enhanced academic environment: The "cluster" model was intended to improve the quality of higher education and promote advanced research by providing shared resources and fostering inter-institutional collaboration.
Integrated courses: The university emphasizes integrated programs, which allow students to earn both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in five years, with an option to exit after three years with an honors degree.
Emphasis on skill development: A key mission of CUS is to focus on skill development and produce a workforce with industry-oriented skills.</p>
