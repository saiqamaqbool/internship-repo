        <article>
          <p>Government College for Women, M.A. Road, Srinagar was established in October 1950. It is a constituent college of the Cluster University of Srinagar, known for offering a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programs across science, humanities, and technology. Recent developments include adopting the National Education Policy 2020, focusing on an inclusive, interdisciplinary learning experience, and incorporating modern technology through events like a recent Drone Tech Bootcamp in Artificial Intelligence. </p>
          <p>The college was founded in October 1950, under the government of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, the then Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. 
It began with eighty students and eight teachers, offering only arts programs and initially located in the "Widow's Palace". 
The college significantly grew between 1954 and 1974, particularly under Principal Mehmooda Ali Shah, and has since been a pivotal force in women's empowerment in the Kashmir Valley. </p>
